\chapter{Quantum computation}
The attempt of this chapter is to synthesize as much as possible the boundless field of quantum computation. Trivializing, quantum computation exploits the properties of quantum mechanics (e.g, superposition and entaglement) to perform computation.

Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer \cite[29]{NielsenChuang}. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time.
