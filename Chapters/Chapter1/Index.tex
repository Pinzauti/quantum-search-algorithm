\chapter{Quantum computation}
The attempt of this chapter is to synthesize as much as possible the boundless field of quantum computation. Trivializing, quantum computation exploits the properties of quantum mechanics (e.g, superposition and entanglement) to perform computation. 
This means a new set of gates, a new unit of information and a new mathematics instead of Boole's one.
