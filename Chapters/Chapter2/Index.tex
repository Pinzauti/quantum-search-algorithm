\chapter{Grover's algorithm}
Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm. The great utility of the  algorithm arises because we do not assume any particular structure to the search problems being performed. It improves unstructured search from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ in the classical case to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$.
