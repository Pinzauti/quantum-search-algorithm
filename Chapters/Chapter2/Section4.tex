\section{Computational complexity}
Let's define some notation:
\begin{defn}[Big $\mathbb{O}$ notation]
   Let $f$ be a real or complex valued function and $g$ a real valued function. Let both functions be defined on some unbounded subset of positive real numbers. One writes
   \begin{equation*}
       f(x) = \mathbb{O}(g(x)) \quad \text{as} \quad x \rightarrow a
   \end{equation*}
   if 
   \begin{equation*}
      \lim_{x \to a} \sup{\frac{\abs{f(x)}}{g(x)}} < \infty
   \end{equation*}
   \end{defn}
   \begin{defn}[Big $\Omega$ Knuth notation]
      Let $f$ be a real or complex valued function and $g$ a real valued function. Let both functions be defined on some unbounded subset of positive real numbers. One writes
   \begin{equation*}
       f(x) = \Omega(g(x))
    \Longleftrightarrow
      g(x) = \mathbb{O}(f(x)).
   \end{equation*}
   \end{defn}
   

\subsection{Performance}\label{sec:performance}
Following the geometric interpretation of section~\ref{sec:geometric-interpretation} we are going to calculate the number of iterations $R$ necessary for the algorithm to find the solution. The initial state of the system is~\ref{eq:initial-state} so rotating through $\arccos{\sqrt{M/N}}$ radians to take the system to $\ket{\beta}$.
\begin{defn}
$\text{CI}(x)$ denote the integer closest to the real number $x$, rounded halves down.
\end{defn}
Then repeating the Grover iteration:
\begin{equation*}
    R = \text{CI}\biggl(\frac{\arccos{M/N}}{\theta}\biggr)
\end{equation*}
times rotates $\ket{\psi}$ to within an angle $\theta/2 \leq \pi/4 of \ket{\beta}$.
\begin{equation*}
    R \leq \frac{\pi}{4} \sqrt{\frac{N}{M}}.
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Optimality of the search algorithm}
We shall show that no quantum algorithm can perform the task of searching through $N$ unsorted items using fewer than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ access to the search oracle.
\begin{theorem}
The quantum search algorithm is optimal. 
\end{theorem}

\subsection{NP vs BPQ}

Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer \cite[29]{NielsenChuang}. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time.
