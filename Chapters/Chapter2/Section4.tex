\section{Computational complexity}
Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer \cite[29]{NielsenChuang}. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time.
