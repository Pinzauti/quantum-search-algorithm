\section{Computational complexity}
Let's define some notation:

Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer \cite[29]{NielsenChuang}. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time.'

\subsection{Optimality of the search algorithm}
We shall show that no quantum algorithm can perform the task of searching trhough $N$ unsorted items using fewer than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ access to the search oracle.
\begin{theorem}
The quantum search algorithm is optimal.
